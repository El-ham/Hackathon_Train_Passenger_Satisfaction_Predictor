    "# 🚄 **Shinkansen Bullet Train Passenger Experience Prediction**  \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This notebook presents the **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training** steps used to predict passenger satisfaction (`Overall_Experience`) for the **Shinkansen Bullet Train**. The dataset consists of two parts: **Survey Data** capturing passenger feedback and **Travel Data** containing travel-related details. Both datasets were merged to create a comprehensive feature set.  \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The project required extensive **data cleaning**, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and aligning the test dataset with the training set. Several machine learning models were tested, and after extensive **hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation**, **XGBoost** was selected as the best-performing model.  \r\n",

    "This notebook focuses only on the **final and optimized approach** that achieved the highest accuracy in the competition. Other models and preprocessing techniques explored during the process are excluded for clarity. 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Implementation Plan**\n",
    "To build an effective classification model, the following steps are performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading & Cleaning** – Handle missing values and preprocess the data.\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering** – Scale numerical features and encode categorical variables.\n",
    "3. **Model Selection** – Train multiple models\n",
    "4. **Hyperparameter Tuning** – Optimize model parameters using **GridSearchCV**.\n",
    "5. **Model Evaluation** – Compare models using **cross-validation accuracy**.\n",
    "6. **Prediction & Submission** – Generate predictions for test data and format the results for submission.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Overview**\n",
    "This step focuses on **transforming categorical features into a machine-learning-friendly format** and **handling missing values** to ensure a clean and consistent dataset for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 Key Steps in This Preprocessing Phase**\n",
    "1. **Categorical Feature Encoding:**\n",
    "   - The dataset includes **ordinal features** (ordered categories like `Seat_Comfort`) and **nominal features** (unordered categories like `Gender`).\n",
    "   - These features are **converted into numerical format** using **One-Hot Encoding**, ensuring all categorical variables are represented in a way suitable for machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "   - The **original categorical columns** are then removed, and the newly encoded columns are added to the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handling Missing Values:**\n",
    "   - **Categorical Features:** After encoding, missing values are **filled with 0** in the newly created binary columns.\n",
    "   - **Numerical Features:**\n",
    "     - The **Age** column is filled with its mean value of **40**.\n",
    "     - Delay-related features like **`Departure_Delay_in_Mins`** and **`Arrival_Delay_in_Mins`** are filled with their **mean values** to avoid data loss.\n",
    "   - A **dictionary of imputed values** is saved to maintain consistency when processing test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Saving Preprocessing Information:**\n",
    "   - The **column names** of the transformed dataset are saved to ensure alignment with the test set during inference.\n",
    "   - A separate file (`numerical_means.csv`) is created to store the computed mean values, which will be applied to the test set for consistency.\n",
    "   - The final **cleaned dataset** (`df_cleaned_one_hot.csv`) is saved for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 Why Is This Step Important?**\n",
    "✔️ **Prepares categorical data** for ML models that require numerical inputs.  \n",
    "✔️ **Handles missing values systematically**, preventing model biases due to inconsistent data.  \n",
    "✔️ **Ensures train-test alignment**, avoiding discrepancies when applying the model to new data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "After this step, we will have a **fully cleaned dataset**, ready for feature scaling and model training.\n"
